# Burntpix Refining script

![Burntpix refiner image](./img/burntpix-refiner-image.webp)

Automated script to refine your favourite [burntpix](http://burntpix.com) on LUKSO! See CLI options below üëáüèª

> _Set with a gas limit of 30 millions gas units._

## How to use it?

1. Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/CJ42/burntpix-refiner.git
```

2. Install the dependencies by running the following command in your terminal

```
npm i
```

3. Create a `.env` file, copy the code snippet below and fill in your private key (without the `0x` prefix).

```
RPC_URL="https://rpc.mainnet.lukso.network"
PRIVATE_KEY=""
```

4. Refine your BurntPix with the command below. You can also use the options below for more fine grained configurations.

```
npm run refine --burntpix-id=[burnt pix ID] --gas-price=0.5
```

## Options

```bash
--burntpix-id  # [Required] `bytes32` token ID of the burnt pix to refine (left padded with 12 x `0x00` bytes)
--gas-price    # [Required] configure gas price per refining tx (in gwei)
--tx-count     # [Optional] total number of refining tx to run (default = 100)
--iterations   # [Optional] number of iterations per refining tx (default = 1,000)
```

# ü´° Upcoming features

- [ ] styling and ASCII art in the terminal üíÖüèª
- [x] new `--iterations` flag üîÑ
- [x] display new total iterations of the burntpix ID for each row in the table
- [x] improve error handling by simulating tx and if failed, return error (prevent dispatching and wasting balance)
- [ ] make `--gas-price` flag optional, using default network gas price from network if not provided
- [ ] Display table at the top with "Refining configs" ("Burntpix ID", "Number of tx", "Refiner Wallet address", "Refiner wallet balance", "Gas price used", "Nb of iterations / tx"). + display if it is the `(default)` or `(custom)` one used (although it might look too much infos).
  - [ ] Add a text above this table `"Starting a Refining job"`.
- [x] Change the `(index)` column to put `Job nb #` and say `x/100` (depending on the number of tx you specified).
- [ ] Retrieve the iterations and cumulated gas of the burntpix by calling the burntpix id using the `iterations()` and `gasUsed()` view function.
      See the Solidity code of `fractal.sol` or in `registry.sol` contract.

- [ ] add in refining summary total number of LYX spent by refiner wallet
- [ ] Allow to pass an array of refiner address in the `.env` file and select which one you want with index on a flag `--refiner=1`
- [ ] It would also be good to have the timestamp of each transaction, as well as an average of the duration between each transaction, that would allow us to know if our fees are too low, or if we are pushing the iterations too hard üòâ
- [ ] In the table summary, add the total LYX spent in gas (sum of all the gas cost of each iteration)
- [ ] Don't make the script crash necessarely if the gas price provided is too low. Instead, make it wait and retry as many times as possible until the gas price fetched is good (make it maybe wait for few minutes / seconds, fetching the gas price regularly and max fee and display it)
- [ ] Improve the code to not have to do `console.clear()`, so that you can scroll up easily in the console.

**Later:**

- [ ] Improve codebase structure by putting everything in a `src/` folder broken down across multiple files
  - [ ] File for spinner frame
  - [ ] File for getting CLI params
  - [x] File for table display
  - [ ] File for refining

# üõ£Ô∏è Future roadmap

- [ ] Interactive CLI mode
  - [ ] Start / Stop
  - [ ] Pause / Continue
- [ ] Being able to pass multiple refiner private keys + refine multiple BurntPix tokenId at once from a single terminal shell (instead of one only)
- [ ] Save refining tx in a JSON file (or a Markdown table)
- [ ] Add iteration goals
- [ ] Add estimator of refining cost to reach a specific number of iterations or a specific number of gas consumed
- [ ] Program the refining script so that if a tx does not fit in a block (because of the high gas it uses), send back a replacement tx with less iterations and less gas used to try to fit in the space left of another block.
